<h1>Teach Access Accessibility Skills Hiring Toolkit</h1>
<p>Teach Access provides the Accessibility Skills Hiring Toolkit to help organizations build internal capacity for producing accessible digital products by developing a knowledgeable and skilled workforce. The toolkit currently provides Position Description Language and Interview Questions.</p>
<p>To democratize accessibility across all departments, we currently do not provide roles and responsibilities for accessibility team-specific jobs. This may change, so check back or contact mindy@teachaccess.org</p>
